        # üèóÔ∏è Welcome to Level 4: XML Engineering for Prompt Crafting! üèóÔ∏è

        Did you know that using XML tags in prompts can significantly enhance the structure and clarity of your instructions to AI models? Similar to Markdown, XML tags help organize different components of your prompt, leading to more accurate and higher-quality outputs.

        In this level, you'll use XML tags to structure your prompts and control the AI's output.

        Your mission:

        1. üìù Create a prompt using XML tags to instruct the AI to write a short story.
        2. üè∑Ô∏è Use XML tags to specify two lists of words:
           - Words that MUST be included in the story: butterfly, moonlight, whisper, adventure, dream
           - Words that MUST NOT be used in the story: the, and, a, is, was
        3. üé≠ Include tags for `<character>`, `<setting>`, and `<genre>`.
        4. üîç Ensure your XML is well-formed (properly nested and closed tags).

        ## üí° Pro Tips:
        - XML tags help separate different parts of your prompt, preventing the AI from mixing up instructions with examples or context.
        - Use consistent tag names throughout your prompt for clarity.
        - Nest tags for hierarchical content: `<outer><inner></inner></outer>`.
        - This technique is particularly effective for models like Claude.
