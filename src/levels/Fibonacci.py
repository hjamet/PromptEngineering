        Let's define our special sequence:
        - It starts with 0 and 3
        - Each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones

        Your mission, should you choose to accept it:

        1. ðŸ”¢ Guide our AI buddy to calculate the 21st term of this sequence.
        2. ðŸŽ¯ Make sure the correct answer is included. It's the star of our math show!
        3. ðŸ§  The AI should do the math, not you. No sneaky calculators allowed!

        ## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:
        Encourage a step-by-step approach. We want to see the journey, not just the destination!

We have a mathematical task involving a modified sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Here are the details:

### Fibonacci Sequence Definition:
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

### Modified Sequence Definition:

- Starts with 0 and 3.
- Each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding terms.

### Your Objectives:

1. Calculate the 21st term of this sequence.
2. Show all terms from the 1st to the 21st, following the format of the example below.
3. Explain briefly how this sequence differs from the traditional Fibonacci sequence.

### Example of Response Format:

Only include the calculations, one term per line, without any explanation:

---
1st term: 0  
2nd term: 3  
3rd term: 3 (0 + 3)  
4th term: 6 (3 + 3)  
...
21st term: [value] ([previous term] + [term before that])
---

Continue this pattern until you reach the 21st term. Make sure to include the calculation in parentheses for each term starting from the 3rd.

Step-by-Step Calculation:
Initial Terms:

Term 1: 0
Term 2: 3
Subsequent Terms Calculation:

Term 3: 0 + 3 = 3
Term 4: 3 + 3 = 6
Term 5: 3 + 6 = 9
Term 6: 6 + 9 = 15
Term 7: 9 + 15 = 24
Term 8: 15 + 24 = 39
Term 9: 24 + 39 = 63
Term 10: 39 + 63 = 102
Term 11: 63 + 102 = 165
Term 12: 102 + 165 = 267

Explanation of the Sequence Difference:
This sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, with each term being the sum of the two preceding terms. However, it differs from the traditional Fibonacci sequence in its initial terms. The traditional Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, whereas this modified sequence starts with 0 and 3. This change in initial terms alters all subsequent terms in the sequence."""
